    <p>In addition to the basic contact details, freshers may also include their LinkedIn profile URL in this section. This can help potential employers learn more about them and their professional background.</p>
    <p>Overall, the personal information section of a resume for freshers is a simple but important section that should not be overlooked. It provides potential employers with the necessary contact details to reach out to the candidate and should be presented in a clear and professional manner.</p>

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kkq0Ef8U1Lw?si=82mD0UNLzZU9zKM6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>For freshers, the educational background section is one of the most important parts of a resume. It should include all the relevant educational qualifications, including degrees, diplomas, and certifications. The order should be from the most recent to the oldest degree.</p>
    <p>It is important to mention the name of the institution, location, and the field of study. If the candidate has achieved any academic recognition, such as honours, awards, or scholarships, it should be mentioned in this section.</p>
    <p>If the candidate has a high GPA (above 6.5), it can be included in this section. However, if the GPA is below 4.5, it is better to leave it out.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of how to format the educational background section:</p></p>
    <table border="1px">
        <th>Degree</th>
        <th>Institution</th>
        <th>Location</th>
        <th>Field of Study</th>
        <th>Year of Graduation</th>
        <tr>
            <td>Bachelor of Engineering</td>
            <td>ABC College of Engineering</td>
            <td>XYZ City</td>
            <td>Computer Science</td>
            <td>2022</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Higher Secondary Certificate</td>
            <td>XYZ School</td>
            <td>XYZ City</td>
            <td>Science</td>
            <td>2018</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Secondary School Certificate</td>
            <td>XYZ School</td>
            <td>XYZ City</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>2016</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
     
    <p>In this example, the most recent degree is a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from ABC College of Engineering. The candidate has also mentioned their Higher Secondary Certificate and Secondary School Certificate, which shows their educational background from the earliest level.</p>
    <p>Overall, the educational background section is an important part of a resume for freshers. It should be clear, concise, and highlight the candidate's academic achievements.</p>

    

   <h3>Skills and Abilities</h3>

   <p> When crafting a resume for freshers, it's essential to highlight both technical skills and soft skills to present a well-rounded profile.
</p>
    <h3>Technical Skills</h3>

    In this section, freshers should showcase their proficiency in specific tools, technologies, programming languages, or any other technical expertise relevant to their field. Utilizing a table format or bullet points can effectively display these skills, providing a clear overview for potential employers.

    <h3>Soft Skills</h3>

    Soft skills encompass personal attributes and interpersonal abilities that are valuable in the workplace. Freshers should emphasize skills such as communication, teamwork, adaptability, problem-solving, and time management. Employing bold or italic formatting can draw attention to these essential qualities, ensuring they are easily noticed by recruiters.

    <h3>Internships and Projects</h3>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCj0Jr-ktp4?si=jcJv2aWZIZhG1IT-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

   <p> Internships and projects are a crucial aspect of a fresher's resume. They showcase the candidate's practical skills, ability to work in a team, and willingness to learn. Including internships and projects in a resume can help a fresher stand out from the crowd and increase their chances of getting hired.</br></br>

    When listing internships and projects in a resume, it is essential to provide detailed information about the role and responsibilities. This information can be presented in a table format, making it easier for the recruiter to scan through the resume. The table should include the name of the organization, duration of the internship/project, and key responsibilities.</br></br>

    It is also important to highlight any accomplishments or achievements during the internship/project. This can be done by using bold or italic font to draw attention to the specific achievements. For example, if a fresher developed a new feature for a software application during an internship, they should highlight this in their resume.</br></br>

    In addition to internships and projects, a fresher can also include any relevant coursework or certifications. This can help demonstrate their knowledge and expertise in a particular subject area. For example, if a fresher is applying for a software development role, they can highlight any coursework or certifications related to programming languages or software development tools.</br></br>

    Overall, including internships, projects, coursework, and certifications in a resume can help a fresher showcase their skills and knowledge to potential employers. It is important to present this information in a clear and concise manner, using formatting such as tables, lists, bold, and italic to make the resume easy to read and understand.
</p>
    <h3>Certifications and Achievements</h3>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LuBUisj7SXA?si=DInBMuFPiS3NUB6x" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

   <p> When it comes to creating a resume, highlighting certifications and achievements can make a big difference for freshers. Certifications can show that the candidate has taken the initiative to improve their skills and knowledge in a specific area. Meanwhile, achievements demonstrate the candidate's ability to deliver results and add value to previous employers.</br></br>

    To list certifications on a resume, freshers should create a separate section and include the full title of the certificate, the issuing organization, and the date of completion. This section should be formatted consistently with the rest of the resume, using the same font and text size.</br></br>

    When listing achievements, freshers should consider the job requirements and study the industry to determine which accomplishments are most relevant. They can then compile a list of all their recognitions and awards and decide which ones to include on the resume. Achievements can be listed in bullet points, using action verbs to describe the accomplishment and quantify the results.</br></br>

    For example, a media buying specialist could list achievements such as managing a monthly ad budget of over $20,000 and maintaining an ad spend ROI of 1.8 for Company X's ad campaigns over the past 3 months. They could also mention how they managed to reduce Company X's search ads average CPC while maintaining the same conversion rate, saving them $2k in monthly ad spend.</br></br>

    In addition to certifications and achievements, freshers should also include relevant skills and experiences on their resume. This can include problem-solving skills, teamwork and collaboration, adaptability, communication skills, and technical proficiency with specific software or tools. By highlighting their strengths and accomplishments, freshers can make a strong impression on potential employers and increase their chances of landing their dream job.

    <h3>References</h3>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kt53EyEw-f8?si=ycPfcbk1u6OlpKJq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

   <p> When creating a resume, including a references section can be beneficial for freshers. It provides potential employers with additional insights into the candidate's qualifications and character. However, it's important to note that including references is optional and may not always be necessary for entry-level positions.</br></br>

    Freshers should consider including references from academic sources such as professors, advisors, or mentors, as well as individuals from volunteer work or internships. These individuals can speak to the candidate's work ethic, skills, and potential, which can be valuable for employers.</br></br>

    It's essential to seek permission from the individuals before listing them as references and to ensure that their contact information is accurate. Additionally, freshers should maintain a separate document with a comprehensive list of references, including their full names, titles, contact information, and the nature of their relationship to the candidate. This organized approach can streamline the hiring process and demonstrate professionalism to potential employers.
