            <p>We prioritize the continuous growth of each team member through regular 1-1s and open communication. As a DevOps Engineer, you'll be part of self-starters thriving on teamwork and constructive feedback.</p>
            <p>We know how to party as hard as we work! When not building tech solutions, find us debating favorite books and games, or gossiping over chai. If a day filled with building impactful solutions with a fun team sounds appealing, join us.</p>
