    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Tiny Changes is all about learning things, applying them in your life and seeing the changes that the tiny learnings/ adjustments can bring about the remarkable changes in your career. 

        We are a team of two people who are both working professionals. We have both faced many challenges before we could get a job starting from how to search for a job opening till facing the interview followed by cracking the interview, so we wanted to help people through this blog on how to deal with these challenges and able to get a job.
        
        Through this blog we wanted to share our thoughts on topics related to job interviews like interview tips, resume building tips, job search tips and stress management tips.</p>
